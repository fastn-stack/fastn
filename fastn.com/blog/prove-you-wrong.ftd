Sometimes, the best surprises come when we let go of our preconceived notions.

It's easy to believe that programming is hard and to some extent, that
perception is not entirely wrong.

But imagine if creating your website is as simple as typing a few lines of text.
Just like our
[`business card`](https://fastn-community.github.io/business-card/how-to-use/)

Every line you write translates into a meaningful piece of your
creation. It feels a lot like writing in English, but with a simple markup.
Within minutes, you'll have a website with a personalized card, made with the
power of programming.

Now, you might wonder, what if you've never coded before?

What if you're unfamiliar with the technicalities?

These concerns are not uncommon.

Navigating a new programming language can raise doubts. The fear of dedicating
time and effort to something that seems out of your grasp is a feeling many can
relate to. We understand your hesitation.

That’s why we are building [`fastn`](https://fastn.com/) for people like you -
for those who've never encountered a line of code before, for those who fear
programming, and for those looking for a more straightforward way to start.

Syntax and technical jargon won't confound you here; you only need the
willingness to try something new.
