I am Harish. On most days, I have a sunny disposition, a sense of humor (I am
told I can be punny! :P) & a genuine interest to know/build cool things. I am a
father to a 5 year old, so I am constantly upgrading my patience & listening
skills. I consciously foster creativity and add new skill-sets / tools to my
arsenal.

I am bullish on Web 3.0. What excites me the most is how current successful Web
2.0 products would metamorphosize & leverage the anonymized, decentralized web.
I am currently building platforms that would allow me to utilize my
understanding of businesses, industries & product to its full potential!
