So we, at FifthTry, are Silver sponsors of [WittyHacks
2023](https://wittyhacks.in). Super excited, first hackathon where people are
using `fastn` to build websites and webapps!

-- ds.h1: Notes For The Participants

Hello! First of all let me thank you for considering `fastn` for your next web
project. This is a new language, and documentation etc are sparse, but we are
here to help!

-- ds.h2: Why should you consider `fastn`?

We believe `fastn`, or maybe something like `fastn` is the future of
programming. Learning to program is hard for people, and we have designed
`fastn` to be easy to learn. So much so that if you know `markdown` you already
kind of know `fastn`. Further, no "web content native" language exists today
for authoring content for web. Markdown is there, but it is quite limited.
`mdx` is putting HTML back in `markdown`, when `markdown` was created with
explicit position that basically writing HTML sucks.

Currently `fastn` is good for authoring static website, you can create
component libraries or use the ones we have already created like
[doc-site](https://fifthtry.github.io/doc-site/) or
[bling](https://bling.fifthtry.site/). The component libraries you create
can be open sourced and added to [featured](/featured/) so people who can not
create their own UI component can use yours to create their websites.

`fastn` has also rudimentary support for writing [backend stuff](/backend/), so
you can start packaging some dynamic websites and web components also.


-- ds.h2: How to Learn `fastn`?

The quickest way is to follow the [short video course we have created:
expander](https://fastn.com/expander/), it takes you through the basics.

Then checkout the [frontend](/frontend/) and [backend](/backend/) sections of
our documentation.

-- ds.h2: We are here to help!

Team from FifthTry, people who have created `fastn`, would be available to help
you answer any questions etc on
[#fastn-fifthtry](https://discord.gg/8sBw9DhewP) channel on `wittyhacks` Discord, and on
[#fastn](https://discord.gg/a7eBUeutWD) channel on `fastn-stack`'s Discord Server.

Further we would be doing office hours at 11AM and a few more times on
Saturday, so you can get on a quick call with `fastn` developers and FifthTry
founder to get your questions answered.
