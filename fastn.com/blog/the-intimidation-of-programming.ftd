With every passing day, new innovations and breakthroughs are
changing the way we interact with the world. Behind these cutting-edge
technologies lies the world of `programming languages`, the building blocks
that bring these innovations to life. However, for many, the prospect of delving
into programming can be quite `scary`.

-- ds.h1: Navigating the Complex Maze of Programming

One of the first challenges faced is deciphering the `complex syntax`. The rules
and structures leave beginners feeling lost and overwhelmed. Beyond the
individual components of code lies the challenge of understanding its overall
structure. How do these lines of syntax come together to create functional
programs?

> **How can one balance logic and presentation to build a website successfully?**

Adding to the confusion is the `abundance of technology options`, frameworks,
and tools, each with its specific purpose. For instance, JavaScript serves one
purpose, HTML another, and CSS an entirely different one.

Each language is the brainchild of different creators with varying goals.
It is up to the learner to figure out the right mix of languages for their
projects.

And as you delve deeper, you encounter the `divergent ecosystem`.
For instance, the JS world, with its varying approaches and tools, further
compounds the complexity.

JavaScript is not easy to learn, nor is it easy to use for authoring
web content. From HTML-based solutions like HTMX to the JSX approach, where
HTML is sparingly written, the diversity can leave beginners unsure of where to
start or which path to follow.

-- ds.h1: The Illusion of Alternatives

Non-programmers might explore CMS or website builders, assuming they are a
viable alternative. Yet, SAAS-based solutions can confine users to the
limitations set by the service, restricting their creative freedom.

The fear of relying on third-party providers looms large; what if they cease
operations or impose undesirable changes?

In contrast, a Programme-based solution offers `long-term viability` and
`independence`. Skilled developers can maintain and evolve the solution over
time, minimizing the impact of potential service interruptions.


-- ds.h1: Seeking a Simpler Solution

In a world where programming might seem intentionally difficult, especially to
those unfamiliar with it, we question the necessity for such complexity.

Shouldn't we have a simpler solution â€” a tool accessible to all, akin to using
Excel? A solution that is stable and easy-to-learn within a few hours.

This question inspired the creation of [**`fastn`**](https://fastn.com/) â€” a
solution that aims to eliminate the intimidation associated with programming.
At `fastn`, we simplify programming, making it accessible to everyone.

`fastn` achieves this by offering a `domain-specific language` optimized for
authoring web content. Its `user-friendly interface and minimal syntax` allow
even those with no prior programming experience to grasp its functionalities
swiftly.

Take the below example for instance,

-- ds.h2: Input

-- ds.code:
lang: ftd

As we continue our journey, fastn is also creating a lot of
[`learning material`](https://fastn.com/expander/) for people to start using it.

Additionally, [`our design community portal`](https://fastn.com/featured/)
serves as a hub for designers and frontend developers to submit their fastn
packages for end users to discover and use.
