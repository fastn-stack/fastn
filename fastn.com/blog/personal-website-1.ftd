-- common.post-meta meta: Building Your Personal Website with fastn: A Step-by-Step Guide
published-on: November 30, 2023
post-url: /blog/personal-website-1/
author: $authors.nandini

Today, I’m excited to share my journey of creating my personal website using
`fastn`. As a content writer, a professional-looking website is vital for my business.
Previously, I used Canva to build [my website](https://www.canva.com/design/DAFbReZ9W-8/UC3KC6uGXfx_vRCnohjdFA/view?website#2),
but in hindsight, it felt more like scrolling through slides. Furthermore, it lacked
essential components such as a navigation bar, blog page, and a contact form.

-- ds.h1: The Limitations of Canva and Notion

Worse yet, my website on Canva took ages to load, forcing me to host
[my portfolio](https://nandhinidevi.notion.site/Hi-I-m-Nandhini-9f393b0846ad472c95529d94fb03d4b8)
separately on Notion, which, despite its functionality, couldn’t match my vision
due to limited design elements.

Honestly, my portfolio there looks more like school notes than a professional
showcase. If you've used Notion, you know what I mean—it’s not the vibe I’d want
to showcase to potential clients.

Then came fastn! When I [first started exploring fastn](https://fastn.com/writer/)
I was eager to try it out for my website - one that has everything I'd like to
showcase to potential clients: details about me, my clients, projects, services,
blogs, and a user-friendly contact form. My goal was to achieve a clean, simple,
yet visually appealing design and layout.

-- ds.h1: Finding the perfect template

Browsing through the templates on the [featured components page](http://fastn.com/featured),
I found exactly what I needed. This single page [fastn template](https://fastn.com/featured/portfolios/portfolio/)
under the Portfolio/Personal Site category ticked all the boxes.

Its structure has a single-page site with a vertical navigation bar, allowing
users to swiftly navigate to specific sections. This feature is a must for a
lengthy landing page. You can easily view the code by clicking on the GitHub
icon if you’re logged into your GitHub account.

-- ds.h3: [**`fastn.ftd`**](https://github.com/fastn-community/saurabh-portfolio/blob/main/FASTN.ftd) file

This file contains all the website imports and its sitemap, outlining sections
and their corresponding URLs.

-- ds.code:
lang: ftd

\-- fastn.sitemap:

# Home: /
icon: assets/home.svg

# About Me: /#about-me

# Services: /#services

# Portfolio: /#latest-works
icon: assets/portfolio.png

# Blog: /#blogs
icon: assets/blog.png

# Contact: /#contact
icon: assets/contact.png


-- note.note: Tip: Using `#` helps create sections on your website.

-- ds.code: Example
lang: ftd

\-- fastn.sitemap:

# Section: <url>

-- ds.markdown:

What precedes the colon becomes the section's title displayed on the webpage,
while what follows it forms the section's URL. For more info, check out the
[How to configure sitemap for your site](https://fastn.com/understanding-sitemap/-/build/)
document.

-- ds.h3: [**`index.ftd`**](https://github.com/fastn-community/saurabh-portfolio/blob/main/index.ftd) file

This file holds the homepage content

-- ds.code:

\-- page:

a user interface flow chart based on container proportion.

\-- end: contact-form

\-- end: footer

\-- end: page

-- ds.markdown:

I appreciate the minimal syntax of fastn. Notice how clean and straightforward
the code of this page appears. Every content component used here is neatly
outlined within the `common` folder. Scroll down beyond `- - end: page`, and
you'll discover the code detailing the layout and design of each component.

-- ds.h3: [**`assets`**](https://github.com/fastn-community/saurabh-portfolio/tree/main/assets) folder

All graphics, including images, icons, and videos, are stored here for easy
organization and access.

-- ds.h3: [**`blog-authors`**](https://github.com/fastn-community/saurabh-portfolio/tree/main/blog-authors) folder

You can pop in more author details by creating individual `.ftd` files. This works
well if you've got a team of writers contributing to your blog.

-- ds.h3: [**`blog-articles`**](https://github.com/fastn-community/saurabh-portfolio/tree/main/blog-articles) folder

Each fresh blog post gets its own `.ftd` file saved right in this folder.
Keeps everything tidy and organized for your blog content.

-- ds.h1: Getting Started with Customizing the Template

Here are a few prerequisites to get started with a fastn template.

-- ds.h2: Step 1: Setting Up Tools and Accounts

[Set up your GitHub account](https://github.com/join) if you haven’t already.

-- note.note: Since fastn is open-source, you can find the source code of all components and templates on the [fastn community on GitHub](https://github.com/fastn-community).

-- ds.markdown:

To create a copy of the template, click `fork repository`. If you are like
me and already have fastn, GitHub desktop, and a text editor installed, simply
copy the `HTTPS URL` of the template. Then, go to your GitHub desktop, clone the
repository, and choose where to save it on your local system.

An alternative way to use the template is by utilizing GitHub Pages to host
your built assets. Follow the steps detailed in this guide
[Publishing Static Site On GitHub Pages](https://fastn.com/github-pages/).

-- ds.h2: Step 2: Adding Assets

I added all my images, icons, and other graphical
elements intended for my website in the assets folder.

-- note.note: When saving graphics, remember to use lower-cased file names, and use hyphens instead of space.

Example: `Profile Picture.png` is incorrect, instead use `profile-picture.png`.

-- ds.h2: Step 3: Editing the Template

I opened the template folder on the text editor. I use Sublime Text Editor, you can use any text editor of your choice.
Later I began editing the `index.ftd` file and moved to the `common.ftd` file.

-- ds.h3: Editing the `index.ftd` file

1) I removed sections or components I won’t be using on my website.

Example:

- `Docs` section
- ` - - info-list:` from the ` - - about-me-info:` section.
- `My Skills` section
- Addresses in the contact form
- Social Links like Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.
- And other content elements wherever it is not needed.

2) I modified the content elements like titles, tags, sub-titles, body text,
CTA button texts, links, and images. Here is my modified hero section:

-- ds.code:
lang: ftd

\-- hero: Are you in the business of saving the planet?
tag: Copywriting for Sustainable Businesses
avatar: $assets.files.assets.profile-picture.jpeg
cta-primary: My Work
cta-primary-link: /#latest-works
cta-secondary: Book a Meeting
cta-secondary-link: https://calendly.com/nandhini-copywriter/discovery-call/

If you're someone who doesn't just sell stuff but rallies behind
a cause, I'll whip up words that'll click with your audience and
turn them into full-on cheerleaders for the planet and your business.

-- ds.markdown:

Here is the edited [`index.ftd`](https://github.com/nandhinidevie/portfoliodemo/blob/main/index.ftd)
file of my website.

-- ds.h3: Editing the `index.ftd` file in the `common` folder

I just replaced and edited text and graphics in the sections as required.
Removed any unnecessary sections and duplicated components if I wanted to add a
new item.

Here is an example of adding a new testimonial:

-- ds.code:
lang: ftd

\-- testimonial list testimonials:

\-- testimonial: Nancy Bayers
designation: Co-Founder
src: $assets.files.assets.testimonial-1.jpeg

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Maxime mollitia,
molestiae quas vel sint

\-- testimonial: Nancy Bayers
designation: Co-Founder
src: $assets.files.assets.testimonial-2.jpeg

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Maxime mollitia,
molestiae quas vel sint

\-- testimonial: Daniya Roy
designation: Co-Founder
src: $assets.files.assets.testimonial-3.jpeg

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Maxime mollitia,
molestiae quas vel sint

\-- end: testimonials

-- ds.markdown:

Here is the edited [`index.ftd`](https://github.com/nandhinidevie/portfoliodemo/blob/main/common/index.ftd) file in the common folder.

Once I made all the changes, I previewed my site locally. You can also
[publish it on GitHub](https://fastn.com/github-pages/)

Now my website is ready to be hosted on a domain and make it live!

-- ds.h1: Final Thoughts

Working on the template was surprisingly smooth, giving me complete control over
every aspect of my website. This includes having a grip on both content and
design and creating neat URLs. I now boast a website I can confidently present
to my network and potential clients.

In my next blog post, I’ll take you on a journey through further enhancements
to this website. Expect insights on integrating new components, fine-tuning
color schemes and typography, adding fresh blog content, optimizing metadata
for SEO and more.

Stay tuned for more updates!
