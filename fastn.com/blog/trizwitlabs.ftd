-- ds.h1: Why `ftd`

`ftd` is a cutting-edge programming language for writing prose. It's a new way
of thinking about web development that's designed to help you build websites
faster and more efficiently than ever before.

Traditional programming languages can be incredibly complex, with steep
learning curves and a lot of trial and error involved. `ftd` simplifies the
process by allowing you to write code in a more natural and intuitive way.

bogged down in the technical details. This makes it an ideal choice for any
one who want to streamline their workflow and create high-quality websites in
 less time.
