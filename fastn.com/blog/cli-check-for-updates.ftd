We're thrilled to announce a game-changing addition to the fastn CLI tool that
will make your developer life easier than ever! Say goodbye to the days of
manually tracking updates because now, fastn has the power to check for updates
automatically.

-- ds.h1: How It Works

When you run the fastn CLI, it will automatically check for updates in the
background. If a new version is available, you'll receive a prompt informing
you of the update and how to install it. You can choose to install it
immediately or defer the update to a more convenient time. This ensures that
your workflow remains uninterrupted.

The automatic check only works when the `FASTN_CHECK_FOR_UPDATES` environment
variable is set, it'll silently check for updates and will only log to the
console if a new version is available.

Additionaly, you can choose to manually check for updates using the `fastn -c`
command.

-- ds.h2: Getting Started

To take advantage of the update check feature in fastn, make sure you have the
latest version of fastn installed. Visit
[fastn.com/install/](https://fastn.com/install/) to download the latest
version.
