SEO is used to enhance a website's organic (non-paid) visibility in search

SEO is an ongoing process instead of one-time optimization. With duration
URLs are changed, meta tags get outdated or data needs to be updated.
Therefore, conducting regular SEO audits to identify areas that can be improved
must be a practice to keep up with the changing world.


-- ds.h1: Optimizing SEO with meta-data for doc-site

Out of many other ways,
`Open-graph meta tags` (og-tags) are key to making your content more clickable,
shareable, and noticeable on social media.

-- ds.h2: Open-graph Meta tags

`og-tags` take over the control of how URLs are displayed when shared on
social-media.

They are part of [Open Graph protocol](https://ogp.me/) that is used by social
media sites like Facebook, LinkedIn, and Twitter (unless there is a dedicated
Twitter tag).

You can find these tags in the `<head>` section of your website.

-- ds.h2: Why are Open Graph tags important

In the midst of content flooding on social media, your website needs to
stand out. People are more likely to see and click shared content with optimized
OG tags because:

1. They make the content more eye-catching in the feeds
2. They tell people what the content is about at a glance
3. These tags help social media sites understand what the content is about,
which can help increase your brand visibility through search.

-- ds.h3: og-tags in `doc-site`

out-of-the-box documentation features that can be used to create any kind of
site.

Any website that uses `doc-site` can very easily add their customized meta
data using properties like `document-title`, `document-description` and
`document-image` in the `page` component of this package.
