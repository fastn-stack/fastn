-- ft.h0: Theme Configuration

Themes should be designed with configuration in mind. Every theme should have
a documented variables exposed that can be used to pass data to the theme.

Packages that depend on the theme you are creating would put the configuration
in their `config.ftd` file.

Say the theme you are creating is `foo.github.io/st`, this is what someone who
depends on your theme may put in their config file:

-- ft.code:
lang: ftd

\-- import: foo.github.io/st

\-- st.primary-color: red

-- ft.markdown:

For this to work you will have to define the variable `primary-color` in your
`index.ftd` file:

-- ft.code: index.ftd of foo.github.io/st
lang: ftd

\-- string primary-color: green

-- ft.markdown:

So theme comes with primary color `green`, but user has changed it to `red`.

And in your rest of the code you should use these variables:

-- ft.code: other files in foo.github.io/st
lang: ftd

\-- import: index

\-- ftd.text heading: $title
caption title:
color: $index.primary-color


-- ft.markdown:

By using variables appropriately many aspects of themes can be customizable.

-- ft.h1: Table Of Content

FPM comes with [`toc` processor](/toc/),

-- ft.code:
lang: ftd

\-- import: foo.github.io/st

\-- st.toc:
$processor$: toc

- https://google.com
  Google
- /some/url/
  Some URL
  - /some/nested/page/
    Supports Nesting as Well


-- ft.markdown:

Here we have used `toc` `$processor$` to create table of content. Table of
content is quite a versatile data type, it can be used to create table of content
in book like contents, or it can be used to create the header navigation links,
links in footer and so on.

Themes should consider using table of content processor as much as makes sense
so authors can have consistent, familiar experience across themes. One or more
instances of variables of type `toc-item list` should be used.
