-- ft.h1: Developer Notes

We use [diffy](https://docs.rs/diffy/latest/diffy/) to create diff:


-- ft.code:
lang: rs

diffy::create_patch(original, modified)


-- ft.markdown:

Note that this creates a diff which is slightly incompatible with `git diff`
output, so we cant use [`elm-diff`](https://terezka.github.io/elm-diff/) for
example.
