-- ds.page: How to use color scheme package?

The importance of color in a website's overall look and feel is well known. The
right color scheme can evoke emotions, create visual interest, and direct a
user's attention to specific elements on a page. That's why the `fastn` color
scheme framework provides an easy and powerful way to define color schemes and
apply them to your website.

To start, you can choose from existing [color scheme packages](featured/cs/) or
create your own custom color scheme. To apply a color scheme package on top of
your package, you'll need to import it into one of the module.


For example, let's say you're using the `page` component from
[`doc-site`](https://fastn-community.github.io/doc-site/) package and want to
apply the [`forest-cs`](https://forest-cs.fifthtry.site) color scheme
package on top of it. You first create a new module, let's say `my-ds.ftd`. Then
you import `forest-cs` package module and then create a new component called
`page` there.

Here's what your `my-ds.ftd` module would look like:

-- ds.code: `my-ds.ftd`
lang: ftd

\-- import: forest-cs.fifthtry.site
\-- import: fastn-community.github.io/doc-site as ds

\-- component page:
children wrapper:
optional caption title:
optional body body:

\-- ds.page:
title: $page.title
body: $page.body
wrapper: $page.wrapper
colors: $forest-cs.main

\-- end: page


-- ds.markdown:

After creating `my-ds.page` component, use this in rest of the module of your
package instead of `ds.page`.

Once you have imported the color scheme package and created a new component
`my-ds.page`, you can use it throughout your website instead of the `ds.page`
component.

With just a few lines of code, you can dramatically change the look and feel of
your website using the `fastn` color scheme framework.
