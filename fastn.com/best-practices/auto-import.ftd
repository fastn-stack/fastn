-- ds.page: Auto-import

We `auto-import` the packages in the `FASTN.ftd` file.

lang: ftd

\-- fastn.auto-import: <package-name>

-- ds.h1: Usage of `auto-import`


**Question:** When do we use `auto-import`?

The answer is, when a component of a package or a package is used in almost all
files of the project.

**Question:** When do we not use `auto-import`?

When a particular component is used just once or twice in a project, we do not
`auto-import` instead we `import` it in the specific file/s where the component
is required.

**Question:** Why do we not `auto-import` all the components or packages?

It downloads the complete package in our project making the size of the project
unnecessarily big.


-- note.note: `fastn` is intelligent

If a package is not used in any `.ftd` file but it is `auto-imported` in the
`FASTN.ftd` file, that package would not be downloaded.
