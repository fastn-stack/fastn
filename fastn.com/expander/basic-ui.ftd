-- ds.page: Basic UI

In this video, I will first show you how to utilize the `fastn packages` that
are there for use. Then, we will continue our learning and understand what are
`Properties` and how to use them. Later, we will use `container components`and
start creating the layout of our Expander project.

-- ds.h1: Featured Components - How to use?

This Crash Course is for everyone, for the one's who want to learn how to
create a components like the one we are going to create in this Crash Course.
And we also respect the choice of those wanting to know **how to use** the
`Featured Components` directly and rather focus on building their websites or
blog-posts or create exciting UIs.



-- ds.markdown:

If you check the [`featured page`](https://fastn.com/featured) you will come
across some amazing components. We are going to use few of them to show. For
our convenience I am going to use these components in a new file `demo.ftd` and
leave `index.ftd` file as it is, so that we can continue our learning there.

As we did earlier, we will add a new file in our project. I have saved the file
as `demo.ftd`. Now, I will apply some of the `featured components`.

Here is the list of packages I have used:

-- cbox.text-4: **doc-site**

 fifthtry.github.io/doc-site


-- cbox.text-4: **admonitions**

  admonitions.fifthtry.site


-- cbox.text-4:  **color-scheme**

fastn-community.github.io/winter-cs


-- ds.markdown:

You can include any such component of your own. For example, I will include the
box component I created earlier.


-- cbox.text-4: **expander**

expander.fifthtry.site



-- ds.markdown:

Using a component is easier than making a sandwich. It can be done in two steps:

- Add the package as a dependency in `FASTN.ftd`

-- ds.code: In FASTN.ftd file
lang: ftd

\-- fastn.dependency: <package-name>


-- ds.markdown:

- Import the package in your file. Here, I am importing it in `demo.ftd`

-- ds.code: In .ftd file
lang: ftd

\-- import: <package-name>


-- ds.markdown:

In the `package-name`, anything that is after the `/` is a default alias. But
sometimes, the alias can be a long one, and if you want to use a component of
that package, you will have to use the long name. Instead, you can give a new
and shorter alias using `as` command.

For example:

-- ds.code: New alias for `doc-site`
lang: ftd

\-- import:fifthtry.github.io/doc-site as ds

-- ds.markdown:

Using the default alias or a new alias, you can use the `components` of the
packages you have imported. These simple steps need to be done everytime you
want to use a new package in your project.

For example:

For `doc-site` package, we have used following components:

- page
- h1

For `admonitions` package, we have used `info` component.


-- cbox.info: Note

With just two steps, just like we did earlier, we can use any `fastn package`
in our project.


-- ds.h1: Let's keep learning
if: { source == "default" }

Let's continue our learning in the `index.ftd` file and build our project
step-by-step.

Following is the list of the `properties` we will apply to the `container
components`.


-- ds.h2: Properties
if: { source == "default" }

-- ds.code: Root ftd.column
if: { source == "default" }
lang: ftd

\-- ftd.column:
padding.px: 50
background.solid: #eee
width: fill-container
height: fill-container
align-content: top-center

-- ds.code: Child ftd.column
if: { source == "default" }
lang: ftd

\-- ftd.column:
border-width.px: 4
spacing.fixed.px: 10
width: fill-container


-- ds.code: ftd.row for Header
if: { source == "default" }
lang: ftd

\-- ftd.row:
width: fill-container
spacing: space-between
border-bottom-width.px: 1
padding.px: 10
