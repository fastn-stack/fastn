-- ds.page: Publishing Static Site On Vercel

Vercel is an incredibly easy to use tool which helps you build and ship your
websites with an easy to use interface.

-- cbox.warning: You Lose Many Dynamic Features In Static Modes

`fastn` comes with a lot of dynamic features, which are only available when you
are using [FifthTry Hosting](https://www.fifthtry.com/)

-- ds.h1: Deploying existing `fastn` projects to Vercel
id: deploy-existing-project

- Add `vercel.json` to the root of your project (right where your FASTN.ftd lives) with the following contents:

-- ds.code: vercel.json
lang: json

{
    "framework": null,
    "buildCommand": "fastn build --base=/",
    "outputDirectory": ".build",
    "installCommand": "curl -fsSL https://fastn.com/install.sh | sh"
}


-- ds.markdown:

- Create a [new Vercel deployment](https://vercel.com/new/) and import your project repository.

-- ds.h1: Creating a new `fastn` project and deploy it on Vercel

We recommend using our template repository
[fastn-template](https://github.com/fastn-stack/fastn-template/) to create a
new `fastn` project.

- Creating your own repository

Open the [fastn-template](https://github.com/fastn-stack/fastn-template/)
repository in your browser and click on the `Use this template` button

-- ds.image: Step I: Use the template repository to initialize your repository
src: $fastn-assets.files.images.setup.github-use-this-template.png
width: fill-container

- Follow the instruction to create a new Github repository from this template.

- Wait for the Github Action to finish running. This Action renames package
  name in `FASTN.ftd` to match with your repository name and your Github
  username.

- We'll be opting for a different deployment method instead of [using GitHub
  Pages](/github-pages/). Feel free to delete the `.github` folder to eliminate
  these GitHub Actions from your repository.

- Now [create a new Vercel deployment](https://vercel.com/new/) by importing
  this repository.

If you have created a `fastn` project from scratch using `fastn create-package
<your-package-name>`. [Follow the instructions above to add a vercel.json file](#deploy-existing-project).
