-- ds.page: Install `fastn`

Before you can use `fastn` you'll need to get it installed.

`fastn` is compatible with various operating systems, including Windows, MacOS,
and Linux. Based on your machine and your choice of installation, you can
select one of the following options:

-- ds.h1:  For MacOS/Linux

-- cbox.info: Recommended

We recommend installing `fastn` using the installer script. You can do this by
running the below command in your terminal. This is the preferred method.


-- ds.code: Installer Script
lang: sh

sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://fastn.com/install.sh)"


-- ds.markdown:

1. [`fastn` through `pre-built binary`](macos/#fastn-through-pre-built-binary)
 (Recommended)
2. [`fastn` from `source`](macos/#fastn-from-source)


-- ds.h1:  For Windows

-- cbox.info: For Windows (Recommended)

We recommend you to install `fastn` through fastn installer:
[fastn.com/setup.exe](https://fastn.com/setup.exe). This is the preferred method
as it only requires downloading the setup and installing it on your local system.
