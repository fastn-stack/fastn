-- ds.page: Install `fastn` on Mac/Linux

For MacOS/Linux machine, there are three ways to install `fastn`.

1. [`fastn` through `pre-built binary`](macos/#fastn-through-pre-built-binary)
 (Recommended)
2. [`fastn` from `source`](macos/#fastn-from-source)


-- cbox.info: Our Recommendation

We recommend you to install `fastn` through `pre-built binary`.

This is the preferred method as it only requires downloading the binary and
installing it on your local system.

-- ds.markdown:

`fastn` is written using `rust` language, if you are familiar with it and want
to use `fastn` for your project or for experimentation, you can do it by
building the `source`.

Based on your choice of installation, you can select one of the following
options:

-- ds.h3: First Step: Copy the Installer Script

Copy the following command:

-- ds.code: Installer Script

-- cbox.info: Installing specific version of fastn

If you want to install any specific version of fastn besides the latest one,
you can use the version flag when installing using the above command.

-- ds.code: Installer Script (for installing specific fastn version)
lang: sh

# Let's say you want to install fastn version 0.3.45
source <(curl -fsSL https://fastn.com/install.sh) --version=0.3.45

-- ds.h3: Second Step: Open the Terminal

You can find Terminal on the Dock or you can search for Terminal using Spotlight
Search. Shortcut to open Spotlight Search, press cmd + spacebar buttons, on your
keyboard.

Once the script runs 100%, installation of `fastn` is complete.


To verify, open terminal and execute the command, `fastn`.

-- ds.h1: `fastn` from `source`

`fastn` is written using rust language, if you are familiar with it and want to
use `fastn` for your project or for experimentation, you can do it by building
the source.

`fastn` is open source project. You can clone the `fastn` github repository:


-- ds.code:
lang: sh

git clone git@github.com:fastn-stack/fastn.git


-- ds.markdown:

`fastn` is implemented using Rust, using 2021 edition, so minimum supported Rust
version (MSRV) is 1.65.0.


-- ds.code:
lang: sh

cd fastn
cargo test
cargo build

-- ds.h2: Linux Dependencies

When building from source you will have to install SSL and SQLite dev packages:


-- ds.code:
lang: sh

sudo apt-get install libsqlite3-dev libssl-dev

-- ds.markdown:

Once you have installed the `fastn` you can start using FTD.

Happy building.
