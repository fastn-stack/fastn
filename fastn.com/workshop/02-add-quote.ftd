-- ds.page: Add quote - `fastn` Workshop

In the [first part](/workshop/hello-world/) we learnt how to display the text in
our local server.

-- cbox.info: Take a note

Before we start with the second step. Make sure to close the server created for
`01-hello-world` then restart the new server for `02-add-quote`.

- Close the server by using `Ctrl + c`
- Change the directory to `02-add-quote` path
- Run `fastn serve --edition=2023` command

**Note:** Make sure to check the port of the new server for `02-add-quote`. If
  it is same as previous, just refresh the browser else copy the new URL with
  different port and run in the browser.


-- ds.h1: Second part

In the second part, we will learn how to add a
[`quote`](https://bling.fifthtry.site/quote/) component that is
[featured](/featured/) in our official website.

`Quote` is a component of `bling` dependency package.

In `fastn`, when we want to use a component of a different package, we have to
do two steps:

- Add the package as **dependency** in `FASTN.ftd`
- `import` the package in the `.ftd` file where you want to utilize the
  component

-- ds.h2: Add the dependency

Here we are adding a dependency of package `fastn-community.github.io/bling`

Uncomment the line where the package is added as dependency in the
[`FASTN.ftd`](https://github.com/fastn-stack/workshop/blob/main/02-add-quote/FASTN.ftd) file

-- ds.h2: Import the package

In the `index.ftd` document we import the `quote` component from bling package.

Uncomment the following lines in the [`index.ftd`](https://github.com/fastn-stack/workshop/blob/main/02-add-quote/index.ftd) file:

- Uncomment the [import line](https://github.com/fastn-stack/workshop/blob/main/a-website/02-add-quote/index.ftd#L4).

- Uncomment the lines where the [component `quote-chalice`](https://github.com/fastn-stack/workshop/blob/main/a-website/02-add-quote/index.ftd#L12) has been called.

Now, save the file and refresh the browser.

Go to the [third step](/workshop/add-doc-site/).
