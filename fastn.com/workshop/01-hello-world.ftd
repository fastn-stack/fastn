-- ds.markdown:

- On GitHub, click on the `Code` and copy the HTTPS `.git` URL
- Open Terminal/command prompt and change the directory to desktop, for easy
access
- Paste or type the below code to clone the repository

-- ds.code:

git clone https://github.com/fastn-stack/workshop.git

-- ds.markdown:

Now, change the directory to the first folder `01-hello-world` through
cmd/terminal.

Run the following command to create a local server:

-- ds.code:

fastn serve --edition=2023

-- ds.markdown:

- Copy the URL and run it on your web-browser.

An empty page will be opened as the `index.ftd` is commented out.

-- ds.h1: Update `index.ftd`

- In the [`index.ftd`](https://github.com/fastn-stack/workshop/blob/main/01-hello-world/index.ftd) file, uncomment the line to print `hello world`

-- ds.image:

-- ds.markdown:

- Save the file and refresh the browser. You will see the text `Hello World`
  displayed.

With just one line of code in `fastn` you can print a text in the browser.

Go to the [second step](/workshop/add-quote/).
