-- import: admonitions.fifthtry.site as cbox

-- ds.page: Add doc-site - `fastn` Workshop

In the [second part](/workshop/add-quote/), we added a component. Now, in the
third step, we will add a documentation site i.e., `doc-site`.

-- cbox.info: Take a note

As we did earlier and will be doing this after every part:

Before we start with the second step. Make sure to close the server created for
`02-hello-world` then restart the new server for `03-add-doc-site`.

- Close the server by using `Ctrl + c`
- Change the directory to `03-add-doc-site` path
- Run `fastn serve` command

**Note:** Make sure to check the port. If it is same as previous, just refresh
the browser else copy the new URL with different port and run in the browser.


-- ds.markdown:

This particular dependency is equipped with components that grant your project a
documentation site-like appearance and functionality.

-- ds.h1: Adding the Dependency

Similar to how we added the `quote` package, we will now include the [`doc-site`
package](https://github.com/fastn-stack/workshop/blob/main/03-add-doc-site/FASTN.ftd#L10) as a dependency in our project.

-- ds.code:

\-- fastn.dependency: fastn-community.github.io/doc-site

-- ds.h1: Auto-Import `doc-site`

To make use of the `doc-site` dependency, we need to import it. Since we are
going to use `doc-site` across all the files therefore instead of importing
`doc-site` in each file we can also `auto-import` in `FASTN.ftd` file itself.

So, go to `FASTN.ftd` file and uncomment the [line number
17](https://github.com/fastn-stack/workshop/blob/main/a-website/03-add-doc-site/FASTN.ftd#L17).

We will also give a shorter alias `ds` by using **`as`** command

-- ds.code:

\-- fastn.auto-import: fastn-community.github.io/doc-site as ds

-- ds.h1: Utilizing the `doc-site` Component: `page`

Now that we've imported `doc-site`, let's use the `page` component.

Follow these steps to remove the comments at [line numbers 12 and
13](https://github.com/fastn-stack/workshop/blob/main/a-website/03-add-doc-site/index.ftd#L12-L13)
and integrate the `page` component into your project.

-- ds.code:

\-- ds.page: Page Title
site-name: My Site

-- ds.h2: Give title and body

Give a personalised title and body to the page component and save and
render the output by refreshing the page in the browser.

-- ds.h2: Add the `end` line

Since `page` is the container type component. You can add any number of
components in its subsection. Like in our case, we have added `quote.chalice`
component (in [line number 16 -
20](https://github.com/fastn-stack/workshop/blob/main/a-website/03-add-doc-site/index.ftd#L16-L20)).

The container type component needs an `end` statement to mark the end of this
container component. So, remove the comment at [line number
31](https://github.com/fastn-stack/workshop/blob/main/a-website/03-add-doc-site/index.ftd#L31).

-- ds.code:

\-- end: ds.page


-- ds.h1: You are done!

**Voila!** Now you have successfully incorporated the doc-site dependency in
your package.

If you miss out any step, checkout the whole source code below:

-- ds.code: In `FASTN.ftd`

\-- import: fastn

\-- fastn.package: hello

\-- fastn.dependency: fastn-community.github.io/bling
\-- fastn.dependency: fastn-community.github.io/doc-site  ;; <hl>



-- ds.code: In `index.ftd`

\-- import: bling.fifthtry.site/quote
\-- import: fastn-community.github.io/doc-site as ds

\-- ds.page: Page Title    ;; <hl>
site-name: My Site         ;; <hl>

\-- quote.chalice: Nelson Mandela

The greatest glory in living lies not in never falling, but in rising every
time we fall.

\-- end: ds.page  		  ;; <hl>


-- end: ds.page
