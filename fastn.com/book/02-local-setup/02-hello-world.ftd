-- ds.page: Hello World with `fastn`

Let's create our first program in `fastn` 

If Fastn isnâ€™t installed yet, go ahead and [Install `fastn` ](/book/install/).

-- ds.h1: Prerequisites

Basic command line knowledge

Git installed on your system (optional but recommended)

We recommend [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com) or
[VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) for working with FTD.


-- ds.h1: Let's create our Hello World program

Let's create a `fastn` package and start coding Hello World.


-- cbox.info: What is `fastn` package?


`fastn` package is a folder that requires atleast two files

- FASTN.ftd
- index.ftd

There can be any number of `.ftd` file but these two files are essential.

-- ds.markdown:

Create a new folder and rename it as first-project, anywhere in your machine. 

Open the newly created folder in any text editor.

Open the folder and add two new files, `FASTN.ftd` and `index.ftd` to create
the `fastn` package.



-- ds.h2: `FASTN.ftd`

It is a special file which keeps package configuration related data like
- package name
- package dependencies
- sitemap, etc

Import the special library, fastn

-- ds.code: Import `fastn`
lang: ftd

\-- import: fastn

-- ds.markdown:

Then, we create a new fastn package after giving line-space

-- ds.code: Create a fastn package
lang: ftd

\-- fastn.package: <project-name>


-- ds.h2: `index.ftd`

To print Hello World, we are using [`ftd.text`](/row/)
section

-- ds.code: Code
lang: ftd

\-- ftd.text: Hello World


-- ds.markdown:

Create a local server and run the URL in the web-browser to see the text
displayed.

Make sure that the directory points to the expander folder you created.

-- ds.code: Terminal command to create local server
lang: ftd

fastn serve


-- ds.markdown:

Using just one line code, we displayed the `Hello World`s.
