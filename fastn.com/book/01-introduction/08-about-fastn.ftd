-- ds.page: FASTN.ftd in `fastn`

The FASTN.ftd file is the central configuration file in every Fastn project.
It defines your website's metadata, dependencies, package structure, routing behavior, 
and layout preferences. Think of it as the foundation of your siteâ€™s logic and structure.


-- ds.h1: Site Metadata

- You can declare your siteâ€™s name, version, and other identifying information using 
the fastn.package section.

-- ds.code: FASTN.ftd package name
lang: ftd

\-- fastn.package: demo.fifthtry.site
    version: 1.0.0
    system-is-confidential: false

-- ds.markdown: 

These details help identify your project and manage versioning.



-- ds.h1: Declaring Dependencies

If your site depends on external 
`fastn` packages (such as a theme or component library), list them using -- fastn.dependency

-- ds.code: `fastn` external dependencies
lang: ftd

\-- fastn.dependency: fifthtry.github.io/fastn-theme

-- ds.markdown: 

This tells Fastn to fetch and include that package during the build.

-- ds.h1: Including internal Packages

If you're working with local packages or want 
to organize your project modularly, you can also include local directories

-- ds.code: `fastn` local dependencies
lang: ftd

\-- fastn.dependency: blog.fifthtry.site
provided-via: demo.fifthtry.site/config/blog

-- ds.h1: Routing (File-Based Routing)

Fastn uses a file-based routing system, so no routing table is required.

Your folder and file structure directly maps to site URLs.

-- ds.code: `fastn` file structure and url
lang: bash

-- ds.h1: Auto Import in FASTN.ftd

In `fastn`, auto-import is a handy feature that lets you automatically make components, 
functions, or variables from a dependency package available throughout your site without 
explicitly importing them in every .ftd file.

This is especially useful for things like

- Layouts

- Reusable components or assets (e.g., buttons, cards)

- Global variables or styles

-- ds.code: Auto import in FASTN.ftd
lang: ftd

\-- fastn.auto-import: fastn.com/assets as fastn-assets


-- ds.h1: Sitemap

`fastn.sitemap` is a special section in `fastn` used to define the structure of 
your websiteâ€”like a table of contents. It helps `fastn` understand

- What pages exist

- Their URLs

- The order in which they appear

- How they're nested (if at all)

-- ds.code: Example FASTN.ftd with fastn.sitemap
lang: ftd

\-- fastn.package: demo
version: 1.0.0

\-- fastn.dependency: roboto-typography.fifthtry.site

\-- fastn.auto-import: demo.fifthtry.site/config/blog as blog

\-- fastn.sitemap:

# HOME: /

# ABOUT: /about/

# BLOG: /blog/
