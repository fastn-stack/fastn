-- ds.page: index.ftd in `fastn`

The `index.ftd` file is a core part of any `fastn` project. 
It serves as the entry point or homepage for your site and is one of the two 
required files in a valid `fastn` package (along with FASTN.ftd).

-- ds.h1: What is `index.ftd`?

- `index.ftd` is automatically mapped to the root route (/) of your site.

- It is the default page that users see when they visit your website or documentation.

- `fastn` looks for `index.ftd` in each folder to render the content at that route.

-- ds.code: Example: Basic `index.ftd`
lang: ftd

\-- ftd.text: Welcome to My Fastn Site!

\-- ftd.text: This site is built using the Fastn framework.

-- ds.h1: Best Practices

- Use index.ftd to introduce your site or section.

- Include navigation or links to other pages.

- Keep content modularâ€”use components where possible.
