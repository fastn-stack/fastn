-- ds.page: `fastn` Essentials



A `fastn` package is a folder (i.e., a directory) that contains all the files and 
configurations required to build a static site or documentation using the `fastn` framework. 
It follows a specific structure that allows `fastn` to understand how to generate routes, 
apply layouts, and include dependencies.


-- ds.h1: Minimum Required Files

Every fastn package must contain at least two essential files

-- ds.h2: FASTN.ftd 

The FASTN.ftd file is the central configuration file in every Fastn project.
It defines your website's metadata, dependencies, package structure, routing behavior, 
and layout preferences. Think of it as the foundation of your siteâ€™s logic and structure.

-- ds.h2: index.ftd  

This file serves as the homepage (/) of your website or documentation.
It is the entry point for users visiting the root URL.
Without index.ftd, your site would not have a default landing page.


-- ds.h1: Additional .ftd Files

Beyond the required two files, you can create any number of .ftd files to 
build out your site's content and structure.
