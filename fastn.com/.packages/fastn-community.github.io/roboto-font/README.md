# Roboto : FPM Font Package

This repository contains a [fastn font package](https://fastn.com/featured/fonts/) containing [Google Font: Roboto](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto/about).

Roboto has a dual nature. It has a mechanical skeleton and the forms are largely
geometric. At the same time, the font features friendly and open curves. While 
some grotesks distort their letterforms to force a rigid rhythm, Roboto doesn’t
compromise, allowing letters to be settled into their natural width.

Designers: Christian Robertson, Principal design
